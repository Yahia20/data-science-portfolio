# **Penguin Clustering Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
You have been asked to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antarctica! The goal of this project is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct groups within the dataset.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset is available in CSV format as `penguins.csv` and was originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long-Term Ecological Research Network.

### **Columns in the Dataset**

| Column              | Description                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| `culmen_length_mm` | Culmen length (mm)            |
| `culmen_depth_mm`  | Culmen depth (mm)             |
| `flipper_length_mm`| Flipper length (mm)           |
| `body_mass_g`      | Body mass (g)                 |
| `sex`              | Penguin sex (Male/Female)     |

Unfortunately, the species of the penguins were not recorded, but researchers know that at least three speciesâ€”**Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**â€”are native to the region. The task is to use data science techniques to group the penguins into meaningful clusters.

## **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Read and examine the dataset.
   - Map categorical `sex` column to numerical values (`Male` = 1, `Female` = 0).
   - Standardize numerical features.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:**
   - Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to visualize data in a lower-dimensional space.
   - Perform **Hierarchical Clustering** and visualize dendrograms.
   - Use **K-Means Clustering** to determine optimal cluster numbers with the Elbow method.

3. **Evaluation and Interpretation:**
   - Identify cluster groupings based on culmen length, flipper length, and body mass.
   - Compute average feature values for each cluster.
   - Visualize clusters using scatter plots and PCA projections.

## **Key Insights**
- The dataset appears to separate into **at least three to four** distinct clusters.
- Features such as **culmen length, flipper length, and body mass** significantly contribute to species differentiation.
- PCA and hierarchical clustering indicate **potential natural groupings** within the data.

## **Results**
- The output DataFrame `stat_penguins` provides the mean of the original numeric features grouped by cluster.
- The clusters likely correspond to **different penguin species** despite missing explicit species labels.

## **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate additional datasets to validate clustering accuracy.
- Use supervised learning if labeled species data becomes available.
- Test alternative clustering methods such as **DBSCAN** or **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**.

### **How to Run This Project**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Run clustering analysis and visualize results.

This project is an excellent demonstration of **unsupervised learning and clustering techniques** in data science. ðŸš€
